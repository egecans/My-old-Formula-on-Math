AIM: 
The aim of this formula is to find a number that is added to the existed fraction to get the requested fraction without creating equations.

When does that happen?  
1-When the existed fraction's numerator and denominator are higher than the requested's.
2-When the fractions are simple.

How?
First, you should divide the existed fraction into the requested fraction without simplification. 
Then you should subtract this result from 1.
The numerator of this result is your answer!

A simple example:
Which number makes the 6/8 equivalent to the 5/6 when it's added to the 6/8's both the numerator and denominator?

Solution:
6/8 / 5/6 = 36/40
1- 36/40 = 4/40
then the answer is 4.

Check:
6+4/8+4 = 10/12 = 5/6  then the answer is correct!
